# Cheat sheet for git
## Rebasing (One way to update your branch)
General idea: "rebase local changes before pushing to clean up your work, but never rebase anything that youâ€™ve pushed somewhere" (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing)

## Merging (other way to update a branch)
Better if your branch has been pushed and others are working on it.

## Stash (uncommited changes ðŸ˜²)
When you want to change branch but you can't since you have uncommited changes, but the changes are not ready to be commited!
```shell
git stash  # When you're in the branch
# ... change branch, do whatever you want ...
# ... go back to the branch ...
git stash pop  # Resume to were you were
