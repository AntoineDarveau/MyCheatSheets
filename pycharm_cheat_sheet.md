# PyCharm cheat sheet

## Synchronise local code with remote host
See tutorial here: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/tutorial-deployment-in-product.html .
More specifically, I recomend the [Automatic upload to the default server](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/tutorial-deployment-in-product.html#upload-to-default-server)
This will synnchronise the remote code with your local project.
